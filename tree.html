In this program, I build a fully left skewed binary search tree (BST) with 26 levels and output the corresponding complete balanced BST. In this program, I demonstrated the insertion of elements starting with an empty BST and then implementing the balance operation to convert it into a balanced BST. I performed the divisions until log2 26 numbers of iterations and computed the system time for both the tree data structures (balanced and unbalanced). Moreover, I have Implemented a Depth First Traversal, Breadth First Traversal and Best First Traversal (based on priority - maximum value in a level) for both the unbalanced and balanced search trees.
