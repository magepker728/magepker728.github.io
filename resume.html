This is a course assignment in which a random starting point in a maze is chosen, and Iâ€™m to write a algorithm that finds and mark a path out of the maze which is represented by a NxN array of 1s (representing hedges) and 0s (representing the foot-paths). There is only one exit from the maze (represented by E).  The algorithm can be programmed to move vertically or horizontally in any direction that contains a 0, and may not move into a square with a 1, but may not move diagonally. In addition to that, If the program lands in a square with 1s on three sides, the program must be to backtrack its path back to its last starting point. For this program, I could only use a single linked list.
